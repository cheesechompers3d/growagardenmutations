    - "Pet mutations, added in Pet Mutation update on July 12, 2025, work in a similar fashion to crop mutations. Rather than boosting the value of your pet, they can buff or change that pet's passive effect. This is on top of giving it a cool new visual flair."

  title: "What is Grow a Garden Mutations?"
  content: "Grow a Garden Mutations is the core mechanic in Roblox Grow a Garden, referring to special mutations that occur to crops, pets, or the environment under certain conditions. Each Grow a Garden Mutations can greatly increase crop value or pet abilities, making it essential for top players to climb leaderboards, collect, and earn Sheckles. With the Grow a Garden Mutations tool, you can automatically track, collect, and utilize all mutations, easily building a billion-profit farm."

howToPlayIntro:
  title: "What are mutations in Grow a Garden?"
  content: "Grow a Garden mutations are special events that alter the appearance and value of your crops. When a mutation occurs, the affected crop's sell value increases dramatically, sometimes by 20x, 50x, or even more. Mutations are the key to maximizing your profits in Grow a Garden.\n\nThe core gameplay loop is simple: buy seeds, grow plants, harvest and sell crops, then reinvest your earnings into better seeds. Mutations add a layer of strategy and excitement, as mutated crops can be worth exponentially more than normal ones.\n\nSome mutations, like Rainbow or Golden, happen randomly, while others can be influenced by planting during special weather events such as Blood Moon or Thunderstorm. By timing your planting and focusing on mutation events, you can earn much more from each harvest.\n\nWhile most seeds produce crops endlessly, some are single-use and require careful planning to maximize their value. Planting high-value seeds during mutation events is the best way to get the most out of your farm.\n\nIn summary, mutations are the most effective way to boost your income and progress quickly in Grow a Garden. Understanding how and when they occur is essential for any successful farmer."

faq:
  title: "Frequently Asked Questions About Grow a Garden Mutations"
  items:
    - question: "What are the rarest mutations in Grow a Garden?"
      answer: "The rarest mutations are Void Touched (135x multiplier) from black hole events, Celestial (120x) from meteor showers, and Shocked (100x) from lightning strikes. These require specific developer-triggered events or perfect weather timing."
    - question: "How do I calculate Grow a Garden mutation values?"
      answer: "Multiply your crop's base value by the mutation multiplier. For example: Soul Fruit (100,000 base) × Golden Mutation (20x) = 2,000,000 coins. Use our calculator above for instant results with all mutation types."
    - question: "Can Grow a Garden mutations stack together?"
      answer: "Yes! Most mutations can stack for incredible multipliers. Golden + Shocked = 20x × 100x = 2,000x total multiplier. However, some mutation types are exclusive and cannot combine with others."
    - question: "When do weather mutations occur in Grow a Garden?"
      answer: "Weather mutations depend on in-game weather events. Frozen mutations need frost weather, Shocked mutations require thunderstorms, and Wet mutations occur during rain. Stay online during weather events to maximize mutation chances."
    - question: "How to get Golden Mutations in Grow a Garden?"
      answer: "Golden Mutations occur randomly with a 1% chance during crop growth. Plant high-value crops like Dragon Fruit or Soul Fruit to maximize profit when you get the golden mutation. There's no special trick - it's pure RNG luck."
    - question: "What is the purpose of mutations in Grow a Garden?"
      answer: "Mutations are the primary progression mechanic in Grow a Garden. They multiply your crop values by 10x to 135x, allowing you to afford expensive upgrades like new plots, pets, and tools. Without mutations, progress becomes extremely slow."
    - question: "Why are mutations important in Grow a Garden?"
      answer: "Mutations are crucial because they're the only way to earn significant coins quickly. Regular crops provide minimal income, but a single Shocked mutation can give you millions of coins instantly. Players who understand mutations progress 10-20x faster than those who don't."
    - question: "How many mutations can stack on a single fruit in Grow a Garden Mutations?"
      answer: "In theory, Grow a Garden Mutations can stack infinitely. Some mutations can combine (e.g., Wet + Chilled = Frosted), and some can coexist (e.g., Bloodlit + Frosted). The maximum mutation multiplier for a single fruit can reach hundreds of thousands or even higher."
    - question: "Can Grow a Garden Mutations decrease crop value?"
      answer: "No, all Grow a Garden Mutations are positive bonuses and will not cause crops to lose value, rot, or fail."
    - question: "How to efficiently get rare Grow a Garden Mutations?"
      answer: "It is recommended to plant high-value crops during special weather or at night, bring pets that can trigger rare mutations, and use Grow a Garden Mutations scripts for auto-tracking and collection."
    - question: "Is the Grow a Garden Mutations script safe?"
      answer: "Grow a Garden Mutations scripts are thoroughly tested and compatible with major executors. Use them reasonably to ensure account safety."
    - question: "Which platforms does Grow a Garden Mutations support?"
      answer: "Supports PC, Android, iOS, and more. Manage your mutation farm anytime, anywhere."
    - question: "How are Grow a Garden Mutations scripts updated?"
      answer: "Scripts are continuously updated according to the Grow a Garden Mutations game version to ensure compatibility and support for new mutations."
