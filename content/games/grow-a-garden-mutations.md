  details:
    Gold: "Gold mutations are hard to obtain since all your fruits have a random chance to get this. The drop rate for Gold mutation is 1%, which means 1 out of every 100 fruits can have it. Moreover, Gold fruits add a 20x multiplier to the sale value in Grow a Garden, thereby helping you make a huge profit. The best way to get a Gold mutation is to fill your garden with loads of plants to increase the chances of spawning such a fruit. In order to identify the Gold mutation, look out for the shiny stars floating around the fruit in your garden."
    Rainbow: "The Rainbow mutation is even harder to get than the Gold one. The reason is that this mutation in Grow a Garden only has a 0.1% chance, which is 1 in every 1000 fruits, of appearing on any random fruit. The fruit will keep changing colors and have a round halo of rainbow colors around it. Although the chances are really low, it adds a whopping 50x multiplier to the sale value of the fruit. So, having a rainbow fruit or veggie grow in your garden can help you make money in Grow a Garden with ease. To have the maximum chances of getting this mutation, you must densely plant crops in your garden and use Advanced or Godly sprinklers in that area."
    Wet: "Wet mutations are relatively easy to obtain and are usually found in larger numbers. Usually, the weather in Grow a Garden is sunny, and it rains occasionally. When it’s raining, your fruits will have a 50% chance to get the Wet mutation, along with a significant boost in plant growth rate. The Wet mutation comes with a 2x multiplier, doubling the sale value of all your fruits. Wet fruits have a characteristic water drop animation that distinguishes them from the regular ones. The best way to get this mutation is, well, wait for the rainy weather."
    Shocked: "The Shocked mutation is one of the hardest (yet best) mutations to get in Grow a Garden. You can get this mutation when the weather in your server changes to Thunderstorms. It happens rarely, but when it does, there’s a small chance for lightning to strike your crops. If it does, the crops will get the Shocked mutation. You may increase this chance by placing a Lightning Rod in your plot. The Shocked fruits glow brightly, emitting light particles, and can be seen from a distance. With this mutation, your fruit gets a powerful 50x sale value multiplier, and sometimes, it can be stacked with Wet, Gold, or Rainbow mutation as well, increasing the price by multiple folds."
    Chilled: "The Angry Plant update introduces the Snow weather condition in Grow a Garden, which increases the chances of two new mutations. The Chilled mutation is one of them that increases the price of your fruits by 2 times its original value. You may not quickly notice any change in the color, rather snowflake-like particles seem to be dropping off from the harvest with the Chilled mutation."
    Frozen: "The last one on your list is the Frozen mutation, introduced alongside the Chilled one in the Angry Plant update. This might be quite hard to obtain since only the Wet mutated harvest can get the Frozen mutation during Snowy weather. Due to the hard nature of obtaining this mutation, you will have an increased money multiplier and thereby boost the sale value of your harvest by 10 times."
    Moonlit: "With the new Lunar event in Grow a Garden, we now have a night cycle in the game for the first time. The best thing about this cycle is that the plants in the garden have an increased chance of getting the Moonlit mutation. This new mutation gives all affected plants 2x sale value. You can increase your chances of getting this mutation by placing the Night Staff found by completing the Lunar Glow quest. The staff will guarantee this mutation on any six random crops from your garden."
    Bloodlit: "The Bloodlit mutation can be obtained only during the Blood Moon event. This is a very rare event that occurs every 3 hours in the game and lasts just 10 minutes. So, you need to be prepared with your garden filled with a large number of multi-harvest plants in your plot to get this mutation on most of the plants. Furthermore, this mutation can increase the sale value of your fruits by 4x, therefore a good deal of profit, if you are lucky enough to get this mutation on most of the plants."
    Celestial: "Celestial mutation can be obtained during the Meteor Shower event in Grow a Garden. Compared to the Blood Moon event, this event occurs more frequently, however, it lasts for a short time, only 3 minutes. So, you need to act fast and consider using the Star Caller Tool to easily attract the meteors and get the Celestial mutation on your plants. Now, if you can sell the Celestial mutated fruits for a massive profit, as it multiplies the sale value by 120x."
    Zombified: "The Zombified mutation is a new mechanic, since this can only be obtained using a Chicken Zombie pet in your garden. The Chicken Zombie pet has a great passive that has a 20.26% chance to grant the Zombified mutation on a random plant every 29.46 minutes. The Zombified mutation can hugely affect the sale value of your fruits by adding a 25x multiplier on them. So, you can consider placing 3 of such pets in your garden to greatly boost this chance of getting this mutation."
    Disco: "This is one of the most exclusive mutations you can obtain in Grow a Garden. Your fruits can only receive the Disco mutation during the admin-exclusive Disco weather. This mutation has the highest sale value multiplier in the game, increasing the price by 125x. Whenever an admin spawns this weather event, the song Raining Tacos by Parry Gripp starts playing, your character starts dancing, and the play area cycles through rainbow colors like a dance floor."
    Plasma: "Here comes another exclusive admin event mutation you can only get when one of the lead developers of Grow a Garden, Jandel, starts the Lazer Storm event in the game. You may not find it on any regular day. Make sure to stay in the game about an hour before the weekly update drops to have a chance of encountering such an event. During the Lazer Storm, a huge Jandel NPC spawns in random areas on the play area and shoots laser beams at various plots and rotates in a circular pattern. With this mutation, your fruits will increase in their sale value by 5 times."
    Twisted: "The Twisted mutation can be obtained only during the Tornado event in Grow a Garden. Although it was announced to occur during the cosmetics update in the game, many players, weren’t able to get this one. So, if you’re among the lucky ones, Twisted mutated fruits can get you 30 times the original value of the fruit."
    Voidtouched: "The Voidtouched mutation is applied to the crops only during a Black Hole event when spawned by the admins or developers of the game. During this event, a massive black hole forms at the top of the play area and attracts players, making them fly all over the place. Moreover, this mutation boasts a sale value multiplier of 135x and is therefore considered the most profitable event in the game."
    Pollinated: "The pollinated mutation was added in the Bizzy Bees update of Grow a Garden. It can be obtained in several ways, including the Bee Swarm event, by placing the various Bee pets in your garden, or by using Robux to deploy the bees manually. As such, this is one easy-to-get mutation in the game and gives you good returns as well, which increases the price of your fruits by 3 times. Furthermore, you can use such plants to get Honey and buy items from the Honey shop."
    HoneyGlazed: "Another new mutation added to the Bizzy Bees update is the HoneyGlazed mutation. Well, no particular event boosts the chances of getting this. However, you can use the Bear Bee obtained from the Bee Eggs and place it in your garden to get HoneyGlazed mutated plants easily. The HoneyGlazed mutation can multiply the fruit’s value by five times, making it easy to make money in the game."
    Heavenly: "If you were on Grow a Garden servers just before the Friendship update dropped, you could have gained an exclusive new mutation. Just an hour before the update was released, the admins ran a special Floating Jandel event in the game that gave random plants the Heavenly mutation. This mutation adds a starry sparkling animation to your fruits, increasing the sell price by 5 times the original price."
    Choc: "The Choc mutation was introduced to the game during the Easter event in Grow a Garden. All you needed to do was complete the Easter event by submitting 30 kg of gold plants to the Easter shop, buying the chocolate sprinkler, and placing it in your garden. This would have given the fruits the Choc mutation instantly. The Choc mutation multiplies the fruit value by 2x. However, a Chocolate sprinkler costs $500,000 at the time, which is now unobtainable. But you can get the Choc mutation using the Choc mutation sprinkler now. Or, if you are lucky, you can witness the admin-exclusive Chocolate rain event, which applies this sweet mutation to random plants in your garden."
    Meteoric: "Jandel’s admin abuse continues in the Working Bees update in Grow a Garden. The developer has added a new admin-exclusive Meteor event, where a meteor drops out of the sky. This event gives your fruit the Meteoric mutation. In terms of looks, the Meteoric mutation is similar to the Celestial mutation in terms of colors and the Pollinated mutation in terms of the aura. As for the price increase, this mutation increases the price of your fruit by 60 times. For reference, the Apple in my hand sells for 67,000 Sheckles."
    Burnt: "Dearly beloved, today we have gathered here to mourn the Twilight Shop owl. It has been cooked and made available as a pet in Grow a Garden. The Cooked Owl is an exclusive pet that was only obtainable by joining the game during the Working Bees update. This pet has a 15% chance to award fruits with the Burnt mutation every 15 minutes. It adds a 4x multiplier to the sell value. The reference image has other mutations too, but we wish to highlight the sooty, burning black design of the Burnt mutation. Earlier, the Red Dragon was rumored to award this mutation. But it has been made available with Cooked Owl, which also awards another mutation."
    Cooked: "The Cooked Owl has a chance to usually apply the Burnt mutation, but it also has a small chance to apply the Cooked mutation to fruits. This mutation has a 10x sell value multiplier, which is just not as good because of the low chance of obtaining it."
    Molten: "The roster of admin-exclusive events grows with a new Volcano event. A massive erupting volcano appears behind the Gear and Pet Shop in the play area. It spews out molten lava cubes, which, when they hit your plants, give fruits in your garden the Molten mutation. This new shiny yellow-and-red mutation has a 35x multiplier in Grow a Garden. So, make sure to have your gardens ready for the mutation the next time the event rolls around."
    Dawnbound: "The Sun God event is one of the most tedious admin-exclusive events that rewards players with the Sunflower in their inventory. Okay, so this event sees Jandel shining as bright as the sun rise from the edge of the play area. When this happens, the game requires players to hold out four Sunflower plants touching each other in front of the Sun God. When four players coordinate and achieve this, they have a low chance of receiving the Dawnbound mutation, which gives the flower a neon yellow glow. The best part of this event is that it gives players the most expensive mutation, as Dawnbound has a 150x sell value multiplier in Grow a Garden."
    Alienlike: "Before the Summer update, Jandel ran the Alien Invasion event. During the event, the UFOs would go to a random plant and throw a teal color ray. This effect applied the Alienlike mutation to random crops. The Alienlike mutation has a teal color effect with some white aura around the crop it is applied to. Moreover, the mutation has a selling multiplier of 100x."
    Galactic: "The Space Travel event took place before the Summer update in Grow a Garden. During the event, an anti-gravity effect was applied to the lobby. Plant growth speed increased by 75%, and the Galactic mutation could be applied. The Galactic mutation has a selling multiplier of 120x."
    Verdant: "The Verdant mutation is obtainable by the Scarlet Macaw’s passive or Solar flare event. So, get the Paradise egg from the pet egg shop and get this pet, or wait for the event. The Scarlet Macaw applies the Verdant mutation every 11.48 minutes with a 16.25% chance in Grow a Garden."
    Paradisal: "When both Verdant and Sundried are present on the same crop, they combine to create the Paradisal mutation. It works similarly to how the Wet mutation turns into Frozen in a winter weather event."
    Sundried: "The Sundried mutation can only be obtained during the Heatwave event in Grow a Garden. Harvests with the sundried mutation have an 85 times boost in their sale value in the game. You can place Tanning Mirrors to get the mutation more easily."
    Windstruck: "The Windy event runs very rarely in Grow a Garden, but it comes with a Windstruck mutation. It does not change the color of the crop. However, you will see a bunch of air bubbles around the fruit that gets this mutation. The Windstruck mutation has a 2x multiplier."
    Drenched: "The developers have upgraded the rainy weather in the game with the new Tropical Rain weather, which not only gives the Wet mutation but also a new Drenched mutation. Similar to wet, this new mutation also sees water droplets, but thicker ones, on the fruit. It has a 5x sale value multiplier."
    Wilt: "Alongside the Heatwave, the Summer update has brought the Drought to Grow a Garden. The lack of water drains the color from plants, turning them pale and light yellow. We will verify the sale value multiplier for this mutation once we witness the event outside the test server."
    Wiltproof: "The new Oasis egg in Grow a Garden brings an upgraded version of the Macaw, colored blue and offering a new Wiltproof mutation. The Hyacinth Macaw applies this mutation, boosting the sale value by 4x in the game."
    Aurora: "Grow a Garden has numerous weather events, and the Aurora Borealis is one of them. It turns the fruit blue and purple, with smoke coming out of the top. We are yet to witness this event ourselves, but other players have reported seeing it. The Aurora mutation offers a 90x sale value multiplier."
    Fried: "In addition to our gardens, the Cooked Owl made a special appearance in the game today during the Fried Chicken event. It danced behind the Gear Shop and rained fried chicken from the sky to award fruits the Fried mutation. This mutation does not change the color of the fruit but shows golden-colored oil dripping from the fruit. The Fried mutation has an 8x sale value multiplier."
    Cloudtouched: "The developers have also introduced a new Cloudtouched mutation that can be attained by using a dedicated mutation spray. We have yet to verify the sale value multiplier, but will update this guide as soon as we learn more."
    Sandy: "Just before the Prehistoric update, the developers introduced Sandstorm event. And with that, we got the Sandy mutation that covers the fruit with a layer of sand. It sells for a 3x value, which is not huge compared to other mutations available currently in the game."
    Clay: "And when there is sand and rain, clay is inevitable. Yes, you can find the Clay mutation in Grow a Garden. To get it, you must get the Sandy mutation on a crop and wait for the Wet mutation to apply to it. While it is a good addition to your crop, the dripping clay look will take away both the Sandy and Wet mutation from our fruit."
    Ceramic: "Another mutation introduced in the Prehistoric update is the Ceramic mutation. You can only get it by applying the Sundried to Clay mutation. It sells for a solid 50x multiplier."
    Amber: "Amber mutation in Grow a Garden looks like Frozen is colored orange. It can be obtained through the Raptor pet or the mutation spray."
    OldAmber: "Keeping the Amber mutation on a crop for a day will get you the OldAmber mutation. It looks more rusty than the Amber and has a higher value multiplier."
    AncientAmber: "By keeping the OldAmber for a further duration will get you AncientAmber mutation. This one looks redder than orange and shows faded white spots across the outside."
    Tempestuous: "By combining Windstruck, Sandy, and Twisted, players can get the Tempestuous mutation. Don’t worry about it much, as it sells for only a 12x multiplier and doesn’t even have the looks."
    Friendbound: "Players can get the adorable Friendbound mutation from the Friendship Pot. This mutation not only looks cute but also sells for a 70x value."
    Infected: "During the Jandel Zombie event, AKA Brains.. event, zombies invade the gardens, applying the Infected mutation. It applies a green tint to the crop while adding some electrifying green aura around it."
